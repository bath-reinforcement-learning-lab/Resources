I imagine everyone should be using the GPU's on hex and therefore everyone will have there own Dockerfile for each of their resources. It makes sense that we share these resources.

In this resource there will be a tutorial on how to set up Dockerfiles / images / containers in order to use HEX. 
(I will do this shortly)

Then there should be extra sensibly named pages which contain a Dockerfile for each resource we might try to use. For instance one which allows GPU use on Hex with Mujoco or Meta-world.

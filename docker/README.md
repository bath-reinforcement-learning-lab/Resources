In this resource there will be a tutorial on how to set up Dockerfiles / images / containers in order to use HEX. 
(I will do this shortly)

Then there should be extra sensibly named pages which contain a Dockerfile for each resource we might try to use. For instance one which allows GPU use on Hex with Mujoco or Meta-world.
